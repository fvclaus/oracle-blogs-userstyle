# Oracle Blogs Userstyle
Userstyle to add a `@media print` style for Oracle Blogs, because I prefer reading printed PDF versions of the article. I used to print the Java Magine before they migrated to Oracle Blogs. Some articles have a `Download a PDF of this article` link, but the PDF suffers from basically the same issues as the `Ctrl+P` version of the article.
